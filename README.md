# Tidy-Tuesday

Tidy Tuesday is an R social data project, details are available here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md

Each week a new dataset is made available. 

I have selected a few that have interested me to work on and plan to continue working through the available data sets.

Astronauts:

Number of astronauts by year of mission split by sex.

Year of mission against year of selection split by sex.

GDPR Violations:

A shiny app which looks at GDPR violations by country and that can be filtered by date.
