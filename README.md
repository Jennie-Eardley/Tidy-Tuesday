# Tidy-Tuesday

Tidy Tuesday is an R social data project, details are available here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md

Each week a new dataset is made available. 

I have selected a few that have interested me to work on and plan to continue working through the available data sets.

Astronauts:

Number of astronauts by year of mission split by sex.

Year of first mission against year of selection split by sex. On average the time between selection and the first mission is longer for male astronauts with a mean of 6.03 years compared to a mean of 5.63 for female astronauts. Additionally, the mean time between selection and the first mission is longer for Russian astronauts at 7.32 years compared to a mean of 5.82 years

A shiny app which looks at GDPR violations by country and that can be filtered by date.
