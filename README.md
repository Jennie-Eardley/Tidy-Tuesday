# Tidy-Tuesday

**Introduction**

Tidy Tuesday is an R social data project providing a wide variety of datasets to visualise, further details are available here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md

I have selected a few that have interested me to work on and plan to continue working through the available datasets.

All of my visualisations use the Tidyverse library. 

**Astronauts**:

Number of astronauts by year of mission split by sex.

Year of first mission against year of selection split by sex. On average the time between selection and the first mission is longer for male astronauts with a mean of 6.03 years compared to a mean of 5.63 for female astronauts. Additionally, the mean time between selection and the first mission is longer for Russian astronauts at 7.32 years compared to a mean of 5.82 years.

**GDPR Violations**:

I made shiny app which looks at GDPR violations by country and that can be filtered by date. I used the shiny and shiny themes libraries.

**Palmer Penguins**:

This is a dataset which provides details of three different types of penguins. I took a look at the correlation between flipper length and body mass by type of penguin. I used the palmerpenguins library.

**Volcanoes**:

The volcano data came from the Smithsonian and gives detailed information about individual volcanoes and eruptions. I decided to focus on Iceland and used leaflet to visualise volcano eruptions on a map. I found the volcano icons on flaticon, credit to "https://www.flaticon.com/authors/dinosoftlabs". If the code is run, you can hover over the volcano icons to get information about the volcano name - below is just a screenshot.
